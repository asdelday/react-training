# 3. First React Component

  * Create our first React Component
  * Render A React Component
  

### Steps:

  * Continue from the previous project...
  * At `./src/`:
    * Create a `components` folder.
    * [Recommendation]: Create an `index.js` at `components` folder which exports all the components.
    * Inside this new folder, create the component: `App.jsx` (recommendation: write each component inside its own folder).
  * At `./src/client.js`:
    * Import our new component `App.jsx`.
    * Render App inside our root node.
  * Verify all is working right.
