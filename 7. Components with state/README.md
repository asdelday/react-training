# 7. Components with state

  * Loops in React JSX
  * Add State to a component
  * Add DOM events in React
  

### Steps:

  * Continue from the previous project...
  * At `./src/components/App`:
    * Create an object to store all the navItems and its state.
    * Add state to `App` component to set the active nav item.
    * Add events and handlers to enable the possibility to switch between nav items.
    * We also test with an input how to change its value using component state.
  * Test everything is right.
